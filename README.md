This project is a simple drag and drop application without using any third party libraries or packages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project was built using [this tutorial from Full Stack Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdDpyD4EMrA) and [Easy React Drag & Drop tutorial from Tyler Potts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MfTv5VRM0A)

NOTES:
1.  To make an element draggable add the "draggable" attribute
2.  To make an area droppable, implement the 'dragover' event.
3.  To capture the drag data, implement the 'dragstart' event.
4.  To capture the drop, implement the 'drop' event
5.  You can also implement the 'drag' event that is fired as the element is being dragged.
